# Model Compression Concepts

This repository contains notebooks for popular model compression techniques which was presented as a tutorial and a lab session for the [Short Course on Deep Learning](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/deeplearningcourse/).

The Program can be found [here.](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/deeplearningcourse/program.html)

This was a Winter School which was held at the [Center for Visual Information Technology](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad, India.](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)

Each notebook contains descriptions about the model compression concept described in it as well the relevant code in Keras with Tensorflow backend.

## Dependencies

- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
